### 1. Image Processing Application
This application is designed to demonstrate basic image processing techniques using C# and Windows Forms. The main functionalities include converting a color image to grayscale, histogram equalization, brightness adjustment, contrast stretching, thresholding, bitwise operations, and image inversion.
## Features
-Open Image: Load an image from your local file system.
-Save Image: Save the processed image to your local file system.
-Convert to Grayscale: Convert a color image to grayscale using pixel manipulation.
-Histogram Equalization: Enhance the contrast of the image by distributing the light intensity values.
-Brightness Adjustment: Increase the brightness of the image.
-Contrast Stretching: Stretch the contrast of the image to improve its appearance.
-Thresholding: Convert the image to a binary image based on a threshold value.
-Bitwise Operations: Perform AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations between two images.
-Image Inversion: Invert the colors of the image.
